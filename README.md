The parents and children have to wait hours for the bus to arrive in the morning pickup
time, and alike is the case in drop-off time. There is also no transparency of the
actual location of a bus. If anything a parent knows, are the words of a driver. There is
a need of technological advancement to help parents, children, and institutions to
bring transparency.

To address the issues in the existing system, there is a pressing need for a
technologically advanced and parent-centric solution that enables real-time tracking
of school buses, provides accurate estimated arrival times, and offers timely alerts
and notifications in cases of unexpected events. Such a solution would enhance the
overall security, convenience, and satisfaction of parents while optimizing
transportation operations for educational institutions. This project aims to develop
and implement a comprehensive "Parent-Centric Student Bus Tracking System" that
tackles these challenges head-on and establishes a new standard of safety and
transparency in student transportation.

Efficient and secure transportation of students to and from school via buses is a
paramount concern for parents and educational institutions alike. This project
introduces a comprehensive â€œStudent Bus Tracking System" aimed at enhancing
the safety and convenience of student transportation. The proposed system
leverages real-time tracking technology and a user-friendly mobile application to
provide parents with the ability to monitor their child's bus location, ensuring timely
and secure drop-off and pick-up.
The system architecture integrates Global Positioning System (GPS) technology to
enable accurate tracking of school buses. By using the GPS location of the driver's smartphone,
the system establishes a continuous communication link between the bus and the
central server. Parents are granted access to a dedicated mobile application that
displays real-time bus locations, and estimated arrival times. Additionally, the
application has the potential to incorporate notifications and alerts to inform parents
of unexpected delays, route changes, or emergencies.
